# RAG System Enhancement - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Enhance the existing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) middleware for small business website visitors with advanced features, analytics, and user experience improvements.

## Current State
We have successfully implemented:
- Enhanced query classification for visitor intent
- Adaptive K selection based on question types
- Result diversity filtering to prevent redundant chunks
- Comprehensive Axiom performance tracking
- Quality thresholds to filter irrelevant context

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Improve Answer Quality**: Implement advanced retrieval strategies for better context selection
2. **Data-Driven Optimization**: Build analytics dashboards to understand system performance and user behavior
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Add smart features that make the chat more engaging and helpful
4. **System Reliability**: Ensure robust performance monitoring and error handling

### Success Metrics
- Improved visitor engagement (longer sessions, more questions asked)
- Higher answer relevance scores (tracked via similarity metrics)
- Reduced response latency for common questions
- Increased conversion rates from chat interactions

## Feature Requirements

### Phase 1: Analytics & Monitoring
**Build Axiom Dashboards**
- Create performance monitoring dashboards
- Track user behavior patterns and popular questions
- Monitor system health and bottlenecks
- Set up alerting for performance degradation

### Phase 2: Advanced Retrieval
**Hybrid Search Implementation**
- Combine semantic similarity with keyword/BM25 search
- Implement multi-query generation for complex questions
- Add reranking models for better chunk ordering
- Cross-document relationship mapping

### Phase 3: User Experience Enhancements
**Smart Chat Features**
- Follow-up question suggestions based on context
- Conversation memory for multi-turn interactions
- Context-aware personalization
- Better error handling and fallback responses

### Phase 4: Performance & Scale
**System Optimization**
- Implement embedding caching for repeated queries
- Database query optimization
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Multi-language support preparation

### Phase 5: Business Intelligence
**Analytics & Insights**
- Visitor behavior analysis from RAG logs
- Content gap identification (questions without good answers)
- ROI tracking and business impact measurement
- A/B testing framework for optimization

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure
- Maintain compatibility with existing Axiom logging
- Ensure backward compatibility with current RAG middleware
- Support for real-time analytics and monitoring
- Scalable architecture for increased traffic

### Performance
- Response time under 2 seconds for 95% of queries
- Support for 100+ concurrent users
- Cache hit rates above 40% for common questions
- 99.9% uptime for the RAG system

### Quality
- Maintain or improve current answer relevance scores
- Reduce false positive retrievals by 20%
- Increase user satisfaction ratings
- Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation

## Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Analytics dashboards (immediate ROI from existing data)
2. **High Priority**: Hybrid search (significant quality improvement)
3. **Medium Priority**: User experience features (engagement boost)
4. **Medium Priority**: Performance optimization (scaling preparation)
5. **Low Priority**: Business intelligence (long-term insights)

## Constraints & Considerations
- Must maintain current API compatibility
- Budget considerations for additional AI model usage
- Privacy compliance for user interaction tracking
- Performance impact of new features must be minimal

## Success Criteria
- 25% improvement in answer relevance scores
- 40% reduction in "I don't know" responses
- 30% increase in visitor engagement metrics
- Successfully handle 5x current traffic volume
- Complete implementation within 8 weeks

## Stakeholders
- Development team (implementation)
- Business owners (requirements and feedback)
- Website visitors (end users)
- Analytics team (monitoring and insights)
